# Software Requirements Specification: Healthcare Provider Application

**1. Introduction**

This application aims to improve the reach of small to medium-sized healthcare providers to patients by offering a user-friendly, digitally accessible platform. The current limitations of digital healthcare solutions for smaller providers, including high costs and limited outreach, are addressed by this multi-tenant cloud-hosted application. The app prioritizes ease of use and streamlined patient journeys, enabling efficient management of health consultations, including scheduling, rescheduling, digital prescriptions, and teleconsultations. Future expansion will incorporate additional services and stakeholder journeys. The target market is 80% of SMEs in the healthcare provider market within a metropolitan city.

**2. Purpose**

To provide a user-friendly, cost-effective, and scalable digital platform for small and medium-sized healthcare providers to connect with and manage patients, improving outreach and customer satisfaction.

**3. Scope**

The application initially focuses on out-patient services, encompassing appointment booking, management, medical profile creation, online payments, prescription management, and a symptom-checking AI chatbot. The application will be hosted on a multi-tenant SAAS platform ensuring data security and privacy for each provider.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-patient and virtual appointment booking and online payment.
* Patient medical history upload and prescription download.
* Appointment scheduling, rescheduling (within 24 hours), and follow-up booking.
* Healthcare provider management of services, practitioners, appointments, and prescriptions.
* Generation of management reports (financial, operational, customer data).
* Doctor access to appointments, patient history, and prescription creation.
* Multi-tenant SAAS hosting with secure and distinct data storage for each provider.
* Compliance with data protection laws (HIPAA, GDPR).
* Automated patient registration.
* AI-driven symptom checker.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers (ambulance operators, pharmacists, medical tourists). Currently, the app does not support the IPD (In-Patient Department) journey of patients. The app does not follow an aggregator model; each patient is linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will grant the application access to their EHR systems via well-documented APIs.
* Appropriate security measures will be implemented to protect sensitive patient data.
* The application will be deployed on a secure and reliable cloud infrastructure.
* The chosen payment gateway will meet all necessary compliance requirements.
