# Structured Requirements Specification for Healthcare Application

**1. Introduction**

This application aims to improve the reach and services of small to medium-sized healthcare providers by offering a user-friendly, digitally accessible platform. The current landscape shows limited digitalization in patient healthcare, leaving many providers with limited customer bases and high churn. This multi-tenant cloud-based application will enhance market share through improved outreach and customer satisfaction. The app prioritizes a simple and intuitive user experience, allowing patients to easily manage health consultations, scheduling, prescriptions, and teleconsultations with minimal clicks. The initial focus is on outpatient services, but the framework allows for the rapid addition of new services and stakeholder journeys. The application will provide each healthcare provider with their own secure, independent instance within a multi-tenant SaaS environment. The target market is 80% of SME healthcare providers in any metropolitan city.

**2. Purpose**

To provide a digital platform for small and medium-sized healthcare providers to connect with patients, improving access to care, enhancing operational efficiency, and expanding their reach.

**3. Scope**

This document details the functional and non-functional requirements for a healthcare application designed for patients, healthcare providers, and doctors. The application will manage appointments, patient medical profiles, prescriptions, and provide reporting capabilities. This app focuses on outpatient services.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-patient and virtual appointment booking and online payment.
* Uploading past medical history and downloading prescriptions.
* Booking follow-up visits.
* Healthcare provider management of services, practitioners, appointments, prescriptions, and medical history.
* Generation of management reports.
* Doctor access to appointments, patient medical history, prescription creation, and appointment status updates.
* Multi-tenant SaaS hosting with secure and distinct data for each provider.
* Compliance with relevant data protection laws (HIPAA, GDPR).
* Automated patient registration and system admin-managed healthcare staff registration.
* Appointment creation by patients, rescheduling (before 24 hours), modification by doctors, and deletion by healthcare staff.
* Patient view-only access to prescriptions; doctors and healthcare staff can create and modify.
* Management reports generated by healthcare staff only.
* AI-driven symptom checker with suggestions for possible causes and doctor types.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients.
Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

This project assumes that healthcare providers will allow interfacing this app with their EHR systems.

**8. Overview**

The application will be a multi-tenant SaaS application providing a streamlined solution for managing patient appointments, medical records, and communication between patients, doctors, and healthcare staff. It aims to improve access to healthcare, enhance operational efficiency, and increase revenue for small and medium-sized healthcare providers. The application will comply with all relevant data privacy regulations. A key feature will be its intuitive design and ease of use for all users. The initial version will focus on outpatient services, but the scalable architecture will allow for future expansion.

**9. Data Model**

The data model will need to accommodate information for Patients, Healthcare Providers, Doctors, Appointments, Services, Prescriptions, and Medical Records. Relationships between these entities will need to be clearly defined. For example, a Patient can have multiple Appointments, each Appointment is associated with a Doctor and a Service, and Prescriptions are linked to Appointments. Medical Records will likely be linked to Patients and Appointments. The system will need to comply with HIPAA and GDPR, requiring robust data security and access controls. A key aspect will be the separation of data for each healthcare provider within the multi-tenant architecture. Integration with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems will need to be considered, requiring adherence to standards like HL7, FHIR, or CDA for data exchange. The data model should incorporate mechanisms for tracking changes to patient data (auditing) and ensuring data integrity. Consider using a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or a NoSQL database depending on specific needs.

**10. User Characteristics**

* **Patients:** Will primarily use mobile and web applications. Technical proficiency will vary, so the application must be intuitive and easy to navigate. Security and privacy of their data are paramount.
* **Healthcare Providers (Staff):** Will use the web application for managing services, practitioners, appointments, prescriptions, and generating reports. They will likely require more advanced features and administrative capabilities than patients.
* **Doctors:** Will primarily use the web application to access patient information, create prescriptions, and update appointment status. Access will be controlled based on their specialization and the patients they treat.
* **System Admin:** Will have complete administrative access to the system for managing user accounts, configurations, and system maintenance.

**11. Codification Schemes**

* **Patient Identification:** Unique patient registration number (PRN) generated upon registration.
* **Appointment Identification:** Unique appointment ID generated upon creation.
* **Service Codes:** Codes to identify different types of services (e.g., general consultation, specialist visit). Consider using standard medical coding systems (e.g., ICD, CPT) where applicable.
* **Diagnosis Codes:** Codes for diagnoses (e.g., ICD codes). Integration with existing EHR systems will be essential for accurate and standardized coding.
* **Medication Codes:** Codes to identify different medications (e.g., RxNorm).
