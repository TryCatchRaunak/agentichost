# Software Requirements Specification: Healthcare Application for SMEs

**1. Introduction**

This healthcare application is designed to improve the reach of small to medium-sized healthcare providers (SMEs) to patients by offering a convenient and user-friendly digital platform. It addresses the limited digital presence of many SMEs, helping them expand their customer base and improve customer satisfaction. The app provides patients with a streamlined experience for managing their health consultations, including appointment booking, rescheduling, accessing prescriptions, and engaging in teleconsultations. The app will initially focus on outpatient services, but its framework is designed for scalability and future expansion. It operates on a multi-tenant SaaS platform, ensuring data security and privacy for each healthcare provider. The goal is to achieve significant market penetration within metropolitan areas.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this app is to bridge the gap between small and medium-sized healthcare providers and their patients through a user-friendly digital platform. By providing convenient features for appointment scheduling, prescription management, and telehealth consultations, the app aims to increase accessibility, improve patient engagement, and enhance the overall healthcare experience. The multi-tenant SaaS architecture ensures the security and scalability needed to serve a growing number of healthcare providers and their patients.

**3. Scope**

This document outlines the requirements for a healthcare application designed to facilitate appointment scheduling, patient management, and communication between patients and healthcare providers. The app will initially support outpatient services, allowing patients to create profiles, book appointments, access prescriptions, and manage their health information. Healthcare providers will be able to manage their services, staff, appointments, and generate reports. Doctors will manage appointments, access patient information, and create prescriptions. The application will be hosted on a secure, multi-tenant SaaS platform.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-patient and virtual appointment booking and online payment.
* Upload and download of past medical history and prescriptions.
* Appointment rescheduling (before 24 hours).
* Healthcare provider management of services, staff, and appointments.
* Doctor management of appointments, patient information, and prescription creation.
* Multi-tenant SaaS platform hosting with secure data separation.
* Compliance with relevant data protection laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
* Automated patient registration.
* AI-driven symptom checker.
* Report generation for healthcare providers.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently, this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients. Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

This project assumes that healthcare providers will allow interfacing this app with their EHR systems.

**8. Overview**

This application aims to modernize healthcare access for patients and enhance operational efficiency for healthcare providers. The app provides a comprehensive solution for managing appointments, patient records, and communication, all within a secure and scalable SaaS environment. The core functionalities include patient registration, appointment booking, prescription management, and reporting capabilities for healthcare providers. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface and incorporates an AI-driven symptom checker for improved patient experience. Future iterations could include expanded features and integration with third-party services.
