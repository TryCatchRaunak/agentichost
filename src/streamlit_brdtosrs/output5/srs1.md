# Software Requirements Specification: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling Application

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the business requirements for a new healthcare appointment scheduling and management application designed to improve the reach and efficiency of small to medium-sized healthcare providers (SMEs). The application will provide a user-friendly platform for patients to manage appointments, access medical records, and interact with healthcare professionals, while offering healthcare providers tools for managing services, appointments, and generating reports. The application will be hosted on a multi-tenant SaaS platform ensuring data security and scalability.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to increase market share for SME healthcare providers by enabling them to reach more patients and enhance customer satisfaction through a convenient and accessible digital platform. This digital platform will streamline healthcare access, reduce operational costs for providers, and offer patients improved appointment management and medical record access.

**3. Scope**

This application initially focuses on outpatient services, including appointment booking, management, medical profile creation, prescription access, and an AI-driven symptom checker. Future expansion may include inpatient services and integration with third-party providers. Each healthcare provider will have a separate instance within the multi-tenant SaaS environment.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* Appointment booking and management (including rescheduling and follow-ups).
* Online payments for appointments.
* Secure access to medical records and prescriptions.
* Healthcare provider tools for managing services, appointments, and staff.
* Doctor tools for managing appointments and prescriptions.
* AI-driven symptom checker.
* Report generation (for healthcare providers).
* Multi-tenant SaaS platform deployment. Compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacist, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients. Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will provide access to their EHR systems via secure APIs.
* The application will utilize existing cloud infrastructure and secure payment gateways.
* Compliance with all applicable healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) will be strictly enforced throughout the development and operation of the application.

**7. Dependencies**

* **External EHR Systems:** The application will depend on seamless integration with existing EHR systems at the healthcare providers. This integration will likely involve APIs or HL7 messaging.
* **Payment Gateway:** The application will depend on one or more integrated payment gateways for processing online payments.
* **AI Symptom Checker API:** The application will depend on a reliable external API for the AI-driven symptom checker.
* **Notification Service:** The application will need a robust notification system (SMS, email) for sending appointment reminders and updates.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** The application's functionality and availability will be dependent on its SaaS cloud platform (e.g. AWS, Azure or GCP).

**9. Overview**

The application will have three primary user roles: Patients, Healthcare Staff, and Doctors. Patients will be able to register, create profiles, book appointments, access prescriptions, and use the symptom checker. Healthcare staff will manage services, staff, appointments, and generate reports. Doctors will access and manage their appointments and create/update patient medical records. The application is designed with a focus on user experience, security, and scalability to meet the needs of both patients and healthcare providers. The application’s architecture will allow for the rapid expansion of services and user journeys in the future.

**10. Data Model**

The data model will be relational, using a SQL database. Key entities include:

* **Patient:** patientID (PK), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, gender, address, phoneNumber, email, emergencyContact, medicalHistory (JSON), registrationDate.
* **Doctor:** doctorID (PK), firstName, lastName, specialization, contactNumber, email, availability (JSON).
* **Appointment:** appointmentID (PK), patientID (FK), doctorID (FK), serviceID (FK), appointmentDateTime, appointmentType, status (e.g., scheduled, completed, cancelled), paymentStatus.
* **Service:** serviceID (PK), serviceName, serviceDescription, price.
* **Prescription:** prescriptionID (PK), appointmentID (FK), medication, dosage, instructions.
* **HealthcareStaff:** staffID (PK), firstName, lastName, role, contactNumber, email.

Relationships will be established through foreign keys. The medicalHistory field will store a JSON object for flexibility. Further normalization may be required based on specific data requirements.

**11. User Characteristics**

* **Patients:** Self-service access; limited data modification permissions; ability to book, reschedule, and view appointments; access to medical records and prescriptions. Authentication via OTP.
* **Healthcare Staff:** Full system access; can manage services, appointments, staff, and generate reports; can modify patient medical profiles. Authentication via OTP.
* **Doctors:** Access to their appointments; can update patient medical records; can create prescriptions. Authentication via OTP. Access limited to their own appointments.

**12. Codification Schemes**

* **Appointment Status:** A lookup table defining status values (e.g., scheduled, completed, cancelled, rescheduled, missed).
* **Appointment Type:** A lookup table defining appointment types (e.g., in-person, virtual, follow-up).
* **Payment Status:** A lookup table defining payment statuses (e.g., pending, paid, failed).
* **Medical Conditions:** May need a controlled vocabulary or standardized code set (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD-10) for medical history and diagnosis.
* **Medications:** Use a standardized medication code set (e.g., RxNorm) for prescriptions.
