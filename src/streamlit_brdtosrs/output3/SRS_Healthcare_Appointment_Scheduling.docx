## System Requirements Specification: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling Application

**1. Introduction**

This application is designed to improve the reach of small to medium-sized healthcare providers to patients by offering a user-friendly, digital platform for managing appointments and other healthcare services.  The current healthcare landscape presents challenges for smaller providers, including high expenses and limited outreach, leading to a smaller customer base and high churn. This app, hosted on a multi-tenant cloud environment, aims to address these challenges and improve market share through enhanced outreach and customer satisfaction.  It prioritizes a simple yet high user experience, enabling patients to easily manage their healthcare consultations with minimal clicks. The initial scope will focus on outpatient services, with the framework allowing for rapid addition of services and stakeholder journeys in the future.  Each healthcare provider will have their own instance of the app, ensuring data security and separation in a multi-tenant SaaS environment.  The ultimate goal is to cover 80% of the SME healthcare provider market within a metropolitan city.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to provide a convenient and efficient digital platform for both patients and healthcare providers. For patients, it simplifies appointment booking, management, access to medical records, and prescription management. For healthcare providers, it offers tools for managing services, onboarding practitioners, managing appointments, generating reports, and improving overall customer outreach. The system's multi-tenant architecture ensures data security and privacy for each healthcare provider.

**3. Scope**

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a healthcare appointment scheduling and management application.  The application will initially support outpatient services, with future expansion planned.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-patient and virtual appointment booking and online payment processing.
* Patient access to past and present medical history, prescriptions, and appointment management.
* Healthcare provider management of services, practitioners, appointments, prescriptions, and medical history.
* Generation of management reports (financial, operational, customer data).
* Doctor access to appointments, patient medical history, and prescription creation.
* Multi-tenant SaaS hosting with secure data separation for each provider.
* Compliance with data protection laws (HIPAA, GDPR).
* Automated patient registration and system admin-managed healthcare staff registration.
* Appointment rescheduling (within 24 hours), and management by healthcare staff.
* Patient access to prescriptions and doctor/staff creation and modification of prescriptions.
* Staff-only management report generation.
* AI-driven symptom checker for patients.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently, this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients.  Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

This project assumes that healthcare providers will allow interfacing this app with their EHR systems.

**8. Overview**

This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing healthcare appointments and related services. It leverages a multi-tenant SaaS architecture to deliver a scalable and secure platform for small and medium-sized healthcare providers. Key features include patient registration, appointment scheduling and management, medical record access, prescription management, and comprehensive reporting.  The system is designed to improve patient engagement and streamline workflows for healthcare providers while ensuring strict adherence to data privacy regulations.

**9. Data Model**

The data model will need to accommodate several key entities:

* **Patient:**  patientID (UUID), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, gender, address, phone, email, emergencyContact, medicalHistory (JSON - allowing for flexible storage of various medical details), registrationDate.  Medical history will likely need further normalization based on specific data points (allergies, chronic conditions, etc.)  Relationships: one-to-many with Appointments and Prescriptions.
* **Doctor:** doctorID (UUID), firstName, lastName, specialization, contactNumber, email, availability (JSON - to store availability details). Relationships: one-to-many with Appointments.
* **Healthcare Provider:** providerID (UUID), name, address, contactNumber, email.  Relationships: one-to-many with Doctors, Services, and Patients.
* **Appointment:** appointmentID (UUID), patientID (FK), doctorID (FK), providerID (FK), appointmentDate, appointmentTime, appointmentType (e.g., in-person, virtual), status (e.g., scheduled, completed, cancelled), paymentStatus, paymentMethod.
* **Service:** serviceID (UUID), providerID (FK), serviceName, serviceDescription, price, availability (JSON - days and times).
* **Prescription:** prescriptionID (UUID), patientID (FK), doctorID (FK), appointmentID (FK), medicationList (JSON - allowing for flexible storage of medication details), creationDate.

**10. User Characteristics**

* **Guest:**  Access limited to exploring the application features. Can register as a Patient.
* **Patient:** Can view appointments, medical profile, prescriptions. Can create and reschedule (within 24 hours) appointments, use AI symptom checker.
* **Doctor:** Can view appointments, update patient medical history, create and modify prescriptions, change appointment status.  Notifications of new appointments.
* **Healthcare Staff:**  Can manage services, doctors, appointments, generate reports, manage patient registration, create/modify prescriptions.  Can delete appointments.
* **System Admin:** Full access to system configuration and user management.

**11. Codification Schemes**

* **Appointment Status:**  A predefined set of values (e.g., "Scheduled," "Completed," "Cancelled," "Rescheduled," "Missed") will be utilized to represent the state of each appointment.
* **Appointment Type:** A predefined list to categorize appointment types (e.g., In-person, Virtual, Teleconsultation).
* **Payment Status:** A set of values (e.g., "Pending," "Paid," "Failed") for tracking payment status.
* **Payment Methods:** A list to handle payment processing (e.g., credit card, debit card, UPI).
* **Medical Conditions:**  Using standardized codes (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD-10) may be beneficial to allow for better interoperability with EHR systems. This will require integration with external data sources or libraries to manage these codes.
* **Medication Codes:** Standardized medication codes (RxNorm or similar) should be used.  Again, external integration with a medication database will be required for effective management.

**12. Dependencies**

* **EHR System:** The application will depend on successful integration with the healthcare provider's Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for accessing and updating patient medical information. This is a critical assumption.
* **Payment Gateway:** Integration with a secure payment gateway is necessary for online payment processing.
* **SMS Gateway:** SMS gateway is required for sending notifications (appointment reminders, confirmation messages).
* **Email Service:** For email notifications (appointment confirmation, reminders).
* **AI/ML Service:** A service providing AI-driven symptom checking capabilities.  (This might be a cloud-based API.)
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Multi-tenant SaaS cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is required, which implies dependencies on the chosen cloud provider's services.

**13. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will allow interfacing the app with their EHR systems.
* Secure and reliable internet connectivity will be available to users and the application's servers.
* The necessary APIs and integrations for payment gateways, SMS gateways, and email services will be accessible and function reliably.

**14. Out of Scope**

* Integration with third-party suppliers (ambulance operators, pharmacists, medical tourists).
* Support for inpatient journeys.
* Aggregator model for patients (each patient linked to a single provider's app).
