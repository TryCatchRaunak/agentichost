# Software Requirements Specification: Healthcare Appointment Management Application

**1. Introduction**

This application is designed to improve the reach of small to medium-sized healthcare providers to patients by offering a user-friendly, digital platform for managing appointments and other healthcare services.  The app addresses the limited digital presence of many healthcare providers, enabling them to expand their customer base and improve patient satisfaction through convenient online features. The app focuses on providing outpatient services initially, with a flexible framework for future expansion.  Each provider will have their own instance within a multi-tenant SaaS environment, ensuring data security and separation. The goal is to reach 80% of the SME market in metropolitan areas.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to provide a convenient and efficient platform for patients to manage their healthcare appointments and access relevant information, while simultaneously providing healthcare providers with tools to manage their services, staff, and patient data effectively.  This will improve access to care and increase efficiency for both patients and providers.

**3. Scope**

The application will initially focus on outpatient services, including appointment booking, management, and related functionalities for patients and healthcare providers.  The system will also include features such as medical profile creation, prescription management, and a symptom checker. Future iterations may include inpatient services and integration with third-party providers.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-person and virtual appointment booking and payment.
* Patient access to past medical history, prescriptions, and appointment details.
* Provider management of services, staff, appointments, and prescriptions.
* Report generation for provider financial, operational, and customer data.
* Multi-tenant SaaS hosting with individual data security for each provider.
* Compliance with relevant data protection laws (HIPAA, GDPR).
* Automated patient registration, with system admin-managed staff and doctor onboarding.
* Appointment rescheduling (within 24 hours), management, and deletion (by staff only).
* Prescription viewing for patients, creation and modification by doctors and staff.
* Report generation for healthcare staff only.
* AI-driven symptom checker with suggested doctor types.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently, this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients.  Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will grant access to their EHR systems.
* Providers will maintain accurate and updated information within their EHR systems.
* The application will be accessed via reliable internet connections.
* All users will have appropriate devices to use the application (mobile, tablet, desktop).

**7. References**

(This section needs to be populated with relevant documentation and standards. Examples include HIPAA, GDPR, and any specific guidelines relevant to EHR system integration and data exchange.)

**8. Overview**

This document outlines the business requirements for a healthcare appointment management application designed for small to medium-sized healthcare providers.  The application will provide a comprehensive suite of features for both patients and providers, focusing on ease of use, security, and scalability.  The system will be hosted on a multi-tenant SaaS platform, ensuring data privacy and security for each provider.  The initial scope is limited to outpatient services, but the architecture allows for future expansion.

**9. Data Model**

The data model will need to represent several core entities:

* **Patients:**  PatientID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Address, PhoneNumber, Email, EmergencyContact, MedicalHistory (JSON field to store various medical information like allergies, chronic conditions, etc.),  RegistrationDate.  Relationships: One-to-many with Appointments and Prescriptions.
* **Providers:** ProviderID (Primary Key), ProviderName, Address, PhoneNumber, Email, Staff (One-to-many relationship with Staff members), ServicesOffered (Many-to-many relationship with Services).
* **Doctors:** DoctorID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, Specialization, ProviderID (Foreign Key), ContactInformation, Availability (JSON field to store availability schedule).  Relationships: One-to-many with Appointments.
* **Staff:** StaffID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, Role, ProviderID (Foreign Key), ContactInformation. Relationships: One-to-many with Appointments.
* **Appointments:** AppointmentID (Primary Key), PatientID (Foreign Key), DoctorID (Foreign Key), AppointmentDateTime, AppointmentType (In-person/Virtual), Status (Scheduled/Completed/Cancelled/Rescheduled), PaymentStatus, Notes.
* **Services:** ServiceID (Primary Key), ServiceName, Description, Price. Relationships: Many-to-many with Providers.
* **Prescriptions:** PrescriptionID (Primary Key), AppointmentID (Foreign Key), Medication, Dosage, Instructions.
* **MedicalRecords:** MedicalRecordID (Primary Key), PatientID (Foreign Key), RecordDate, Diagnosis, LabResults (JSON field), Notes.

**10. User Characteristics**

* **Guests:** Can browse the application and register as patients.
* **Patients:**  Can view their medical history, book appointments, reschedule (within 24 hours), view prescriptions, use the symptom checker.
* **Doctors:** Can view appointments, update patient medical histories, create/modify prescriptions, update appointment status.
* **Staff:** Can manage services, onboard/offboard doctors, manage appointments (including deletion), generate reports, create/modify prescriptions.
* **System Admin:**  Can manage staff accounts, system configurations.

**11. Codification Schemes**

* **Service Types:**  (Will need to be defined based on the specific services offered by providers.  This could be an extensible list.)

**12. Dependencies**

* **EHR System Integration:** The application relies on the successful integration with existing EHR systems of the healthcare providers.  This will involve APIs and data exchange protocols (e.g., HL7, FHIR).
* **Payment Gateway:** A reliable payment gateway is crucial for online payments.
* **Notification System:**  A robust notification system (SMS and email) is needed for appointment reminders and updates.
* **AI-driven Symptom Checker:**  The symptom checker relies on an external AI service or a locally deployed AI model.

**13. Conclusion**

This SRS document outlines the requirements for a healthcare appointment management application designed to improve access to care and efficiency for both patients and providers.  The application will provide a comprehensive set of features, ensuring data security, scalability, and compliance with relevant regulations.  Successful implementation will depend on the integration with existing EHR systems and other third-party services.
