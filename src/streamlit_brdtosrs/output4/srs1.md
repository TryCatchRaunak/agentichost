# Software Requirements Specification: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling Application

**1. Introduction**

This application is designed to improve the reach and services of small to medium-sized healthcare providers by providing a user-friendly, digital platform for patients to manage their healthcare consultations.  The app addresses the limited digitalization in the healthcare sector, particularly for smaller providers who often lack the resources for developing their own digital solutions.  The app offers features for appointment booking and management, with a framework that allows for easy expansion of services and user journeys in the future. It will be hosted on a multi-tenant cloud environment, ensuring each provider has their own secure data space. The target market includes 80% of SMEs in the healthcare provider market of a metropolitan city.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to bridge the gap between small to medium-sized healthcare providers and their patients by providing a convenient and efficient digital platform for appointment scheduling, management, and related services.  This will enable healthcare providers to increase their market share and customer satisfaction through improved outreach.  The app will also improve the patient experience by simplifying the process of accessing healthcare services.

**3. Scope**

The application will initially focus on outpatient services, including appointment booking and management, patient profile creation, medical record access (though the app will not store the data, only interface with the EHR), prescription management, and an AI-driven symptom checker. Future development may include inpatient services and integration with third-party suppliers.

**4. In Scope**

* Patient registration and medical profile creation.
* In-patient and virtual appointment booking and payment.
* Uploading and downloading medical history and prescriptions.
* Appointment rescheduling (before 24 hours).
* Healthcare provider management of services and practitioners.
* Generation of management reports (by healthcare staff).
* AI-driven symptom checker.
* Secure data storage in a multi-tenant SAAS environment, complying with relevant data protection laws (HIPAA, GDPR).  The EHR data itself is not stored in the app's cloud platform.

**5. Out of Scope**

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourists are out of scope of this app presently. Currently this app doesn't support the IPD journey of patients.
Since this is a multi-tenant SAAS environment, this app would not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.

**6. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will grant access to their EHR systems via APIs.
* The payment gateway will have reliable uptime and integration capabilities.
* The cloud hosting platform will provide the necessary security and scalability.

**7. References**

*(None explicitly provided in the document.  This section would typically list any relevant documents, standards, or specifications.)*

**8. Overview**

The application provides a comprehensive solution for both patients and healthcare providers.  Patients benefit from a streamlined appointment process, access to their medical records and prescriptions, and an AI-driven tool to assist with symptom assessment.  Healthcare providers gain access to a scalable and secure platform to manage their services, practitioners, appointments, and patient data, allowing them to expand their reach and improve patient care.  The application's modular design allows for future expansion and integration with additional services and features.

**9. Data Model**

The data model will need to accommodate several key entities:

* **Patient:**  patientID (primary key),  firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, gender, address, phoneNumber, email, emergencyContact, medicalHistory (JSON field allowing for flexible storage of various medical details, including chronic conditions, allergies, medications, family history, and immunization records), registrationDate.
* **Healthcare Provider:** providerID (primary key), providerName, address, phoneNumber, email, contactPerson.
* **Doctor:** doctorID (primary key),  firstName, lastName, specialization, providerID (foreign key), contactNumber, email.
* **Service:** serviceID (primary key), serviceName, serviceDescription, price, providerID (foreign key), availableDays, availableTimes,  doctorID (foreign key).
* **Appointment:** appointmentID (primary key), patientID (foreign key), doctorID (foreign key), serviceID (foreign key), appointmentDate, appointmentTime, appointmentType (e.g., in-person, online), appointmentStatus (e.g., scheduled, completed, cancelled), paymentStatus (e.g., paid, unpaid), paymentMethod, notes, prescription (JSON field for storing prescriptions).
* **Prescription:** prescriptionID (primary key), appointmentID (foreign key), medicationName, dosage, frequency, duration.
* **Medical Record:** medicalRecordID (primary key), patientID (foreign key), recordDate, diagnosis, testResults, notes.  This entity primarily acts as a bridge between the app and the external EHR system; it may contain minimal data within the app itself, mostly pointers or references to the data in the external EHR.

**10. User Characteristics**

* **Guests:** Can explore the app, but cannot access protected resources or create appointments.  They need to register to become a patient.
* **Patients:** Can create, view, and manage appointments; view prescriptions; use the symptom checker; and update their medical profile.
* **Healthcare Staff:** Can create, edit, and delete services; manage appointments; onboard and offboard doctors; generate management reports; and access patient medical records (though data is not stored in the app's database, only interfaced with the EHR).
* **Doctors:** Can view their appointments; update patient medical history within the context of appointments; modify appointment status; create and upload prescriptions and generate a printout; and access patient medical profile information within their appointments.
* **System Admin:** Full administrative access, including user management.

**11. Codification Schemes**

* **Appointment Status:**  (e.g., scheduled, completed, cancelled, missed, rescheduled). This needs to be a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency.
* **Appointment Type:** (e.g., in-person, online, virtual).  Again, a controlled vocabulary is crucial for consistent data handling.
* **Payment Status:** (e.g., paid, unpaid, pending, refunded).  This will likely require integration with a payment gateway's specific status codes.
* **Medical Conditions:**  Use standardized medical codes (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED CT) where possible to facilitate data interoperability.
* **Medication Names:**  Use standardized medication names and codes (e.g., RxNorm) for accuracy and consistency.

**12. Dependencies**

* **External EHR Systems:** The application depends on seamless integration with the EHR systems used by the healthcare providers.  This will likely involve APIs and potentially HL7 or FHIR standard messaging.
* **Payment Gateway:**  A secure and reliable payment gateway is required to handle transactions.
* **Cloud Hosting Platform:** A multi-tenant cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) is necessary for scalability and secure data storage.
* **AI Symptom Checker:**  An AI-driven symptom checker engine (possibly a third-party API) needs to be integrated.
